# Lab 3: Sampling and Sampling Distributions

<script>

</script>


## Learning Objectives

1. Create sampling distributions from a "population" dataset.
2. Interpret sampling distributions, especially with respect to sample size.
3. Use the "filter" function to randomly sample from a dataset, as well as select specific cases from a dataset.

### Important Info 

In order for our computers to run a bit faster, we use a version of the EngageNS Quality of Life data that only contains four variables for this activity. It can be downloaded on  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrumpLab/statisticsLab/master/data/WHR2018.csv" download>Moodle ADD LINK</a>. Download this file to your computer before the beginning of your lab session. Have it open in JAMOVI at the beginning of your lab session.

In addition, have a new Excel spreadsheet open. You can use Excel on your computer or Office365 ADD LINK.

## JAMOVI - Week 8 - March 8 & 9

<div class="marginnote">
This lab activity was developed by Erin Mazerolle and Sherry Neville-MacLean.
</div>

When we read about research, only one set of results are presented to us - the results from the sample obtained by the researchers. However, it's important to realize that the particular results obtained are completely dependent on the sample. This means, that if they repeated the exact same data collection, but the sample included different participants, the results would be different. "How different?" is an extremely important question. Through this lab activity, you will see that the answer depends quite a bit on sample size.

For the purpose of this lab activity, we are going to define all the data in the EngageNS dataset as the population (i.e., all 12871 rows). We are going to randomly sample from that population, using different sample sizes.

You should have four columns of data in the "CIW-NovaScotiaQualityofLife-SHAREDSurveyData-May2020_cleaned_2022-02-28_SamplingLabActivity.omv" datast: PC1, REGION, VOLUNTEER, and R_FRIENDS.

First, we need to set up our analysis. As we have done in previous labs, go to Analyses->Exploration->Descriptives. Move the R_FRIENDS variable into the Variables box. 

Remember, you can use the data dictionary to learn what the variables are. R_FRIENDS is the revised (cleaned) FRIENDS variable. FRIENDS is described in the data dictionary as:

```{r , echo=FALSE,dev='png'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/FRIENDSdictionary.png')
```

Ask yourself, what is the scale of measurement of R_FRIENDS? Is it recorded correctly in JAMOVI?

Back to the JAMOVI program, expand the "Statistics" section. For this activity, we are going to focus on the mean and the sample size, so deselect everything else. Your JAMOVI window should look something like this:

```{r , echo=FALSE,dev='png'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/AnalysisSetup.png')
```

<div class="marginnote">
While the file has 12871 rows, your table will display an N of 12710. This is because there is no data in this column for some participants. 
</div>

We are going to repeatedly randomly sample using different sample sizes and record the mean each time.  

Click the "Data" tab and then click "Filters":

```{r , echo=FALSE,dev='png'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/Filters.png')
```

The following Row Filters panel will be displayed:

```{r , echo=FALSE,dev='png'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/FiltersPanel.png')
```

Filters allow us to select a subset (or sample) of the data. In this case, we are going to randomly select samples of different sizes. You can see that all the rows are selected by looking at the "Filter 1" column that has appeared as the leftmost column. The green checks indicate that those rows are included. 

We will start with a sample size of 5 (N = 5). To create a sample from our population of 12871, we are going to use the SAMPLE function. This will tell JAMOVI to select 5 rows at random. Type SAMPLE(REGION,5) after the equals sign, as follows:

```{r , echo=FALSE,dev='png'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/SAMPLEN5.png')
```

We use "REGION" in this filter as a placeholder. The filter also works if you use "VOLUNTEER".

Now, you will have a new Results table. Yours might have different numbers, but mine looks like this:

```{r , echo=FALSE,dev='png'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/ResultsN5.png')
```

The N might not be exactly 5, as your random sample might include rows with missing data.

In your Excel spreadsheet, name a column "Means for N = 5" and input your mean into the next row:

```{r , echo=FALSE,dev='png'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/ExcelN5.png')
```

Repeat this process 20 times, to record the mean from 20 random samples. 

Once you have 20 samples, input your means into the class spreadsheet.

Then, create a new column in your Excel spreadsheet, "Means for N = 500" and repeat the process, but this time select random samples of 500.

Once you have 20 samples with N = 500, input those into the class spreadsheet.

Return to Moodle to complete the homework. You will be asked to upload your individual spreadsheet, as well answer questions on a homework quiz. 

### Other types of filters

Perhaps you are interested in the number of friends reported by those who volunteer versus those who don't volunteer. You can use the filter in JAMOVI to get the mean number of friends for each group.

To find out the number of friends reported by those who volunteer, type VOLUNTEER==1 into the filter function:

<div class="marginnote">
The double equals sign, ==, checks for equivalence. This is commonly used in programming language because a single equals sign is used to assign or set a value to a given variable.
</div>

```{r , echo=FALSE,dev='png'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/FilterVolunteer.png')
```

We see that the mean number of friends reported by participants who volunteer is 5.71:

```{r , echo=FALSE,dev='png'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/ResultsVolunteer.png')
```

### Homework Problems (draft - to move to Moodle)

___

1. What is the mean of R_FRIENDS of the entire dataset? How does it compare to the means of samples of N = 5? N = 500? Which of the two sample sizes is more likely to cause you to make a big error estimating the mean of R_FRIENDS for the entire dataset? Explain your reasoning.

2. Report the mean and standard deviation of R_FRIENDS for two groups: Those who do volunteer and those who do not volunteer.

3. Report the mean and standard deviation of R_FRIENDS for those who live in the Antigonish-Guysborough region.
