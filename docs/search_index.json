But I think most of it came from Gosset. F. N. David This lab is modified and extended from Open Stats Labs. Thanks to Open Stats Labs (Dr. Kevin P. McIntyre) for their fantastic work. 7.1 Do you come across as smarter when people read what you say or hear what you say? 7.1.1 STUDY DESCRIPTION Imagine you were a job candidate trying to pitch your skills to a potential employer. Would you be more likely to get the job after giving a short speech describing your skills, or after writing a short speech and having a potential employer read those words? That was the question raised by Schroeder and Epley (2015).The authors predicted that a persons speech (i.e., vocal tone, cadence, and pitch) communicates information about their intellect better than their written words (even if they are the same words as in the speech). To examine this possibility, the authors randomly assigned 39 professional recruiters for Fortune 500 companies to one of two conditions. In the audio condition, participants listened to audio recordings of a job candidates spoken job pitch. In the transcript condition, participants read a transcription of the job candidates pitch. After hearing or reading the pitch, the participants rated the job candidates on three dimensions: intelligence, competence, and thoughtfulness. These ratings were then averaged to create a single measure of the job candidates intellect, with higher scores indicating the recruiters rated the candidates as higher in intellect. The participants also rated their overall impression of the job candidate (a composite of two items measuring positive and negative impressions). Finally, the participants indicated how likely they would be to recommend hiring the job candidate (0 - not at all likely, 10 - extremely likely). What happened? Did the recruiters think job applicants were smarter when they read the transcripts, or when the heard the applicants speak? We have the data, we can find out. 7.2 Lab skills learned Conduct independent samples t-tests Generate figures Discuss the results and implications 7.3 Important Stuff citation: Schroeder, J., &amp; Epley, N.

Below is how to load the .csv data from the online repository, or from a local file (you need to change the file path to where the local file is, if you downloaded it). The data contains all of the measures and conditions from Experiment 4. library(data.table) # load from github repo #all_data &lt;- fread(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrumpLab/statisticsLab/master/data/SchroederEpley2015data.csv&quot;) all_data &lt;- fread(&quot;data/SchroederEpley2015data.csv&quot;) # load from file on computer 7.4.2 Inspect data frame This will give you a big picture of the data frame. Click the button to view it in your browser, then take a look to see what is in it. library(summarytools) view(dfSummary(all_data)) 7.4.3 Find the data you need This time the data comes pre-filtered for us. The authors ran lots of experiments, but we only have the data from Experiment 4. This is great, we dont need to subset the data frame to find all of the data that we need. But, we do still need to understand what data we want to analyze. Lets start with identify the column that codes the experimental conditions for whether or not the evaluator read a transcript or heard the interview. 7.4.3.1 Condition variable Lucky for us, the condition variable is called CONDITION! Lets take a look. We printed it out just by writing down all_data$CONDITION. There 0s and 1s for each condition (audio vs. transcript). But which one is which? This isnt clear from the data, and it isnt clear from the paper, or from the repository. We have to do some guess work. I went ahead and computed the means for the Intellect_rating between each condition, and then compared those to the graph in the paper for E4. It looks like 1 = audio condition, and 0 = transcript condition. all_data$CONDITION ## [1] 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 ## [39] 1 aggregate(Intellect_Rating~CONDITION,all_data,mean) ## CONDITION Intellect_Rating ## 1 0 3.648148 ## 2 1 5.634921 Lets use words instead of 0s and 1s to refer to our experimental conditions. To do this, we will chance the values of 0 and 1, to the words transcript and audio. We can do this in two steps. First we convert the CONDITION column to a factor. This will automatically turn the 0s and 1s into strings (not numbers, text). Factors have an internal variable for the names of the levels, which will be 0 and 1. We can simply change the level names to transcript and audio. all_data$CONDITION &lt;- as.factor(all_data$CONDITION) levels(all_data$CONDITION) &lt;- c(&quot;transcript&quot;,&quot;audio&quot;) Now if you look at the all_data variable, you will see the words transcript and audio, where 0s and 1s used to be. 7.4.3.2 Dependent Measures Next its time to find the dependent measure columns. The graph from the paper shows three different measures in each condition. These included Intellect, General Impression, and Hiring Likelihood. Every evaluator (either given a transcript or audio recording of the interview) gave ratings on a scale of 1 to 10 for each of those concepts. Its not immediately clear which columns in all_data correspond to those three measures. There are lots of different measures that could be the ones they reported. It turns out the relevant ones are called Intellect_Rating Impression_Rating Hire_Rating In this tutorial we are going to walk through doing an independent samples t-test for the first measure, Intellect_Rating. You can follow these same steps to complete the same kind of t-test for the other two variables. 7.4.4 Look at the dependent variable. Question: Why do we always want to look at the data? What is the first thing we do before even considering an inferential test? Look at the data. Always look at the data. We could make a dot plot or histogram of the data from the Intellect_ratings. But, from our last lab we already learned how to make graphs showing most of the information we would want to look at. For example, we could make a bar graph that has the means for each condition (transcript vs. audio), standard errors of the mean and the actual scores as little dots. This would be great to look at it. Not only will it tell us if there are really weird numbers in the data (who knows maybe the data file is corrupted, you need to look), it will also give us strong intuitions about what to expect for the t-test. We can plot each score as a dot using the all_data data frame. If we want to add on a layer for the sample means, and for the sample standard errors, we have to compute those and put them in a new data frame first. Then we use both data frames with ggplot to plot all of the information. We will use dplyr to quickly get the means and the standard errors and put them in a new data frame called decriptive_df. library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:data.table&#39;: ## ## between, first, last ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union library(ggplot2) # get means and SEs descriptive_df &lt;- all_data %&gt;% group_by(CONDITION) %&gt;% summarise(means= mean(Intellect_Rating), SEs = sd(Intellect_Rating)/sqrt(length(Intellect_Rating))) # Make the plot ggplot(descriptive_df, aes(x=CONDITION, y=means))+ geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, aes(fill=CONDITION))+ # add means geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=means-SEs, # add error bars ymax=means+SEs), width=.1) + geom_point(data=all_data, aes(x=CONDITION, y=Intellect_Rating), alpha=.5)+ geom_point(alpha=.25)+ ylab(&quot;Rating&quot;) This plot is very useful. First, we can see the numbers in our dependent measure are behaving sensibly. We know that the numbers have to be between 1-10, because those were the only options in the scale. If we found numbers bigger or smaller, we would know something was wrong. Checking for things that are obviously wrong in the data is one reason why we always look at first. We are checking for obvious errors. There are other ways to check to, but looking is fast and easy. Question: Why are the standard errors of each sample an appropriate thing to use for error bars? Now that you can see the patterns in the data, you should form an intuition about how the independent samples t-test will turn out. You can see how big the error bars (+1/-1 standard error of each sample man). The t-test will tell us whether the observed difference (or greater) is likely due to chance. Should we find a big t-value or a small t-value? Should we find a big p-value or a small t-value. If you understand how t-values and p-values work, the answer should be very clear from the graph. You should already know how the t-test will turn out before you run it. Running it will confirm what you already suspect to be true. 7.4.5 Conduct Independent samples t-test Question: Why are we conducting an independent samples t-test, and not a one-sample or paired samples t-test? We use the very same t.test function that we used last time to conduct a t-test. The only difference is that we dont tell the R to use a paired sample t-test. We leave the paired=TRUE statement out, and R automatically knows we want to do an independent samples t-test. Remember to set the var.equal=TRUE, otherwise R will compute a different version of the t-test. You can use different syntax to run the t-test. Because our data is already in a data frame we can use this syntax. t.test(Intellect_Rating~CONDITION, data=all_data, var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: Intellect_Rating by CONDITION ## t = -3.5259, df = 37, p-value = 0.001144 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group transcript and group audio is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -3.1284798 -0.8450652 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group transcript mean in group audio ## 3.648148 5.634921 The t.test function also will work on two variables, not in a data frame. For example, the following does the same thing. But, its harder to read, and the means are described in terms of X and Y, not terms of transcript and audio, like the report above. t.test(all_data[all_data$CONDITION==&#39;transcript&#39;,]$Intellect_Rating, all_data[all_data$CONDITION==&#39;audio&#39;,]$Intellect_Rating, var.equal=T) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: all_data[all_data$CONDITION == &quot;transcript&quot;, ]$Intellect_Rating and all_data[all_data$CONDITION == &quot;audio&quot;, ]$Intellect_Rating ## t = -3.5259, df = 37, p-value = 0.001144 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -3.1284798 -0.8450652 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 3.648148 5.634921 Question: What conclusions do we draw from the t-test? Based on these results, if you were being evaluated for a job interview, would you rather have the evaluator read a transcript of your interview or listen to an audio recording? So, now we have the t-test. It shows the t-value, the p-value, and the means for each group. You can double-check with the paper to see if we found the same results as reported by the authors. 7.4.6 Remaining ratings Now, you should use what you have learned to analyse the last two ratings for the dependent variables Impression_Rating, and Hire_Rating. This is your task for the generalization exercise. Remember to plot the data for each, and conduct a t-test for each. Then compare what you found to the original article. What did you find, and what do the results mean? 7.4.7 Reconstructing the graph from the paper The results from Experiment 4 in the paper plot the means and error bars (+1 / -1 SEM) for all three dependent measures, for both experimental conditions. We can do this in ggplot using the data. We will have to make a couple changes to the data frame. But, it wont be too hard. What we need to do is make a fully long form data frame. Remember a long form data frame has one row per dependent measure. The all_data frame is partly long and partly wide. If we are only interested in one dependent measure, then it is a long data frame for that measure. For example, example if we are only interested in plotting Intellect_Rating, then we already have one observation of that dependent measure for each row. But, in the other columns, the dependent measures for Impression_Rating and Hire_Rating are in the same rows. Before continuing, it is very much worth mentioning that this part of data analysis happens a lot, and it is kind of annoying. I call it the rubix cube problem, because we need to rotate and transform the format of the data to accomplish different kinds of analysis goals. Its good to be able to know how to do this. This problem occurs all of the time, and can occur for any software package. Its a good thing you are learning R, because we can do these things easily in R. They are not often so easy to do without a computer programming language like R. The worst thing to do is transform the data by hand. That really sucks. Believe me you dont want to do it. Why? Because you will make mistakes, and you will mess up the data, then you will mess up your analysis. And, you wont be able to find your mistakes, and it will take you ages to correct them. That sucks. Theres more than one way to transform data in R. For example the cast and melt functions do this kind of thing. You can look those up. In this example we will not use those functions. Instead we will show some steps to build the required data frame one step at a time. # repeat CONDITION column three times condition &lt;- rep(all_data$CONDITION,3) # make a ratings variable with all three ratings in one variable ratings &lt;- c(all_data$Intellect_Rating, all_data$Impression_Rating, all_data$Hire_Rating) # make a new factor variable with the names of the ratings # need to repeat each level name the appropriate number of times num_to_repeat &lt;- length(all_data$CONDITION) rating_type &lt;- rep(c(&quot;Intellect&quot;,&quot;Impression&quot;,&quot;Hire&quot;),num_to_repeat) # put the new variables into a data frame plot_all &lt;- data.frame(condition,rating_type,ratings) # Get the means and standard errors for each rating by condition descriptive_all &lt;- plot_all %&gt;% group_by(condition,rating_type) %&gt;% summarise(means= mean(ratings), SEs = sd(ratings)/sqrt(length(ratings))) ## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;condition&#39;. You can override using the `.groups` argument. # Make the plot ggplot(descriptive_all, aes(x=rating_type, y=means, group=condition))+ geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, aes(fill=condition), position=&#39;dodge&#39;)+ geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=means-SEs, ymax=means+SEs), width=.1, position = position_dodge(width=.9)) + geom_point(data=plot_all, aes(x=rating_type, y=ratings, group=condition), alpha=.25, position = position_dodge(width=.9))+ geom_point(alpha=.25)+ ylab(&quot;Rating&quot;) Well, we didnt make the exact graph. We have the bars, the error bars, and we added the individual scores because they are useful to look at. Otherwise, its the same graph (except the the ordering of bars is determined alphabetically here. We change that in ggplot, but we wont do that today.) 7.4.8 Generalization Exercise (1 point - Pass/Fail) Complete the generalization exercise described in your R Markdown document for this lab. Now, you should use what you have learned to analyse the last two ratings for the dependent variables Impression_Rating, and Hire_Rating.

If your answer is generally correct but very difficult to understand and unclear you may receive half points for the question 7.5 Excel How to do it in Excel 7.6 SPSS In this lab, we will use SPSS to: Perform an independent-samples t-test Graph the data 7.6.1 Experiment Background Schroeder and Epley (2015) conducted an experiment to determine whether a persons speech (i.e., vocal tone, cadence, and pitch) communicates information about their intellect better than their written words (even if they are the same words as in the speech). To conduct this study, the authors randomly assigned 39 professional recruiters for Fortune 500 companies to one of two conditions. In the audio condition, participants listened to audio recordings of a job candidates spoken job pitch. In the transcript condition, participants read a transcription of the job candidates pitch. After hearing or reading the pitch, the participants rated the job candidates on three dimensions: intelligence, competence, and thoughtfulness. These ratings were then averaged to create a single measure of the job candidates intellect, with higher scores indicating the recruiters rated the candidates as higher in intellect. The participants also rated their overall impression of the job candidate (a composite of two items measuring positive and negative impressions). Finally, the participants indicated how likely they would be to recommend hiring the job candidate (0 - not at all likely, 10 - extremely likely). So, what happened? Did the recruiters think job applicants were smarter when they read the transcripts, or when the heard the applicants speak? We have the data, and we can find out. 7.6.2 Performing an independent-samples t-test First, lets open the relevant data file in SPSS. You should have already downloaded this data file from section 0.2.3 of the lab manual - we used it when we worked through the exercises in Chapter 12 of the lab manual. The file we are working with in this lesson is called SchroederEpley2015_Study4_data.sav. Your data should look like this: For our analysis, we will focus on only one of the three measures mentioned above: intellect. We want to know if perceived intellect is different in the audio condition (where recruiters listened to a job pitch) than in the transcript condition (where recruiters read a transcript of a job pitch). Before we run the t-test, lets review a button at the top of our SPSS spreadsheet window. This will be important for identifying the values assigned to groups later on. The button I refer to here is highlighted below; it has two boxes, one with an A and one with a 1 on it, with arrows in-between. Press this button and see what happens to your data spreadsheet: Notice that this button has revealed the values used to signify the Audio and Transcript groups. We will need to know that these groups are signified by 0s and 1s when we come to running our t-test. If you click the button again, the cells will go back to displaying their labels. Keep in mind that revealing the values or labels does not change anything about the data itself or any subsequent analyses; it is merely a cosmetic change. Now, were ready to run the independent-samples t-test. Go to Analyze, then Compare Means, then Independent Samples t-test A window will appear asking you to specify which variable to use in this analysis. Remember, we are only using intellect, so find this variable in the left-hand list and move it into the Test Variable(s) field on the right using the arrow. For the field labeled Grouping Variable, we will specify which variable is our independent variable. That variable is CONDITION (we have two conditions: audio and transcript). Move CONDITION into the Grouping Variable field. Notice that next to the variable name there are two question marks and the OK button is disabled: Here, SPSS wants to know the values used to signify these conditions (remember the 0s and 1s?). So, click Define Groups, and place 0 and 1 in the fields that ask for Values for Group 1 and Group 2. Click Continue, and then OK. SPSS will produce output tables as follows: The t-test output has similarities with the paired t-test output we saw in Chapter 6 of this lab manual. Like the paired t-test output, the first table contains useful descriptive statistics that help us understand the pattern of results and contextualize our inferential statistics. In the case of an independent-samples t-test, there is one special consideration to be made: the equality of variances. One of the assumptions of a t-test is that the groups being compared have roughly equal variances. Conveniently, the independent-samples t-test in SPSS performs another test automatically to determine if the variances are equal or not: this test is called the Levenes test. In the second output table, there is a section dedicated to Levenes test. The rule is as follows: If the Sig. value under the Levenes test heading is smaller than your alpha level, then your variances are not equal and you must refer to the values in the second row of the table, labeled Equal variances not assumed. If the Sig. value for Levenes test is larger than alpha, then you can use the top row labeled Equal variances assumed. However, I recommend that you always use the Equal variances not assumed row. In this case, the Sig. value associated with the Levenes test is .35, which is greater than the conventional alpha level of .05, so you might use the Equal variances assumed row, but we are still going to use the Equal variances not assumed row. The t-statistic for our independent-samples t-test is -3.48, the degrees of freedom are adjusted to 33.43, and the p-value for the t-test is .001. Note: Be sure to look at the p-value associated with the t-test and not Levenes test when you are interpreting your t-test results. What does the t-test tell us about the data? We can put our finding into words to clarify: Recruiter ratings for audio job pitches (M = 6.63, SD = 1.61) are higher than ratings for transcripts of pitches (M = 4.65, SD = 1.91). This difference is significant, t(33.43) = -3.48, p &lt; .05. The default SPSS output also includes effect sizes in the third table. You can include Cohens d in your results sentence as well. Find it in the Independent Samples Effect Sizes table in the first row, in the Point Estimate column. For example: Recruiter ratings for audio job pitches (M = 6.63, SD = 1.61) are higher than ratings for transcripts of pitches (M = 4.65, SD = 1.91). This difference is significant according to an independent samples t-test, t(33.43) = -3.48, p &lt; .05, d = 1.13. Some formatting guidelines for writing results sections: All of the numbers are rounded to two decimal places, but if your p-value was .0001, it would be OK to write p &lt; .001. Italicize symbols such as p and t. There are spaces on either side of =, &gt;, or &lt; symbols. 7.6.3 Graphing your data CONDITION in this experiment represents a discrete, categorical variable. Therefore, we will be using a bar chart to visualize this data. To begin, go to Graphs, then Legacy Dialogs, then Bar Next, choose Simple in the window that appears, then click Define. In the next window, make sure that under Bars Represent, you have chosen Other statistic. Move your variable of interest (intellect) into the field labeled Variable. Then, move CONDITION to the category axis field. Next, click Options. Then choose Display Error Bars, and have them represent Standard Error with a multiplier of 1. Click Continue, then OK. SPSS will produce a bar graph of your mean ratings for both audio and transcript conditions. Note: Its always a good idea to compare your graph to the descriptive statistics to make sure it looks right. 7.6.4 Optional exercises (good practice and review for the take-home final exam) At this point, youve covered everything you need to successfully complete the homework assignment below. However, there are a number of different analyses we can practice with this dataset. This section walks you through some optional analyses to consolidate what weve already covered as well as add breadth. If youre running out of time, skip down to the Homework now. You can return to these exercises later (i.e., when studying). 7.6.4.1 Using a cut point to define groups for an independent t-test Sometimes you will see groups defined with a non-nominal independent variable. For example, in class we talked about defining countries as overweight or not overweight depending on whether 50% of their population was classified as overweight. The rate of overweight is known for each country, but we can divide the countries into two groups at an arbitrary cut point (in this case, a rate of 50%). Aside: This is a good example of how an ordinal, interval, or ratio variable might be considered to have distinct categories - you have to define the boundaries of the categories yourself first. A commonly used cut point is the median value (this is called a median split). Lets use the example of age in the current dataset. You can find the median value of age via many menus. Lets go Analyze, then Descriptive Statistics, then Frequencies. Move age to the Variable(s) box and then click Statistics. Select Median, then click Continue and then OK. The first output table contains the median: We can use the median of 29 as the cut point. Well be running an independent t-test to determine whether there is a significant difference in intellect between candidates under 29 years old and over 29 years old. Click Analyze, then Compare Means, then Independent Samples t-test Its likely that intellect is already selected as your Test Variable(s), but do so if not. Then, move age to the Grouping Variable (you may need to move CONDIITION out first). Then click Define Groups Select Cut point and input 29 as follows: Click Continue and then OK. You should get the following output tables: Practice writing a sentence describing the results, and then compare it to #1 in the Example answers to practice problems below. 7.6.4.2 Review: Correlation Lets say you had a different research question: Is the age of the candidate correlated with intellect ratings? You could answer this question with the same variables analyzed in the section above, but using correlation instead of an independent t-test. Click Analyze, then Correlation, then Bivariate and move age and intellect into the Variables box: Click OK. The output table should look as follows: As we noted in the previous lab session on correlations, some of the information in this output table is redundant or not useful. We can clean that up by changing some of the options in the Bivariate Correlations dialog. Click Analyze, then Correlation, then Bivariate, but this time, select Show only the lower triangle and unselect Show diagonal (both found near the bottom). Click OK. Now the output is tidier: Write a sentence describing the results of this test. Compare your answer to #2 in the Example answers to practice problems below. Now, assume you are in the mood to do some exploratory data analysis. We can run multiple bivariate correlations at the same time in the same dialog. Click Analyze, then Correlation, then Bivariate again. To the Variables box, add wordcount, time, and impression, in addition to age and intellect: Click OK. Now our output table contains the r- and p-values for each possible pair of the five variables: SPSS flags significant correlations for us with an * or **. In this case, we see a ** next to the correlation between impression and intellect. The note at the bottom of the table indicates that the correlation is significant at the 0.01 level. SPSS automatically indicates whether correlations are significant at .05 or .01. If your Sig. (p-value) is between .05 and .01, SPSS will flag it as * (significant at the 0.05 level) and if your Sig. (p-value) is less than .01, SPSS will flag it as ** (significant at the 0.01 level). Lets pick a few pairs of variables and make scatterplots. We have a good range of different correlations in this table, so we can use these data to practice identifying correlations of different strengths. Click Graphs, Legacy Dialogs, and then Scatter/Dot. Then click Simple Scatter and then Define. Move intellect into the Y axis and age into the X axis. Click OK. This should produce a scatterplot in the output file. Repeat for all correlations with intellect, using intellect on the Y axis each time to make it easier to compare to the example answers below (#3). Compare the pattern of dots in each scatterplot to the r-values reported in the tables. Can you see the differences between the plots? Can you tell from the scatterplots whether we have violated any of the assumptions of Pearsons r (i.e., linearity, no outliers)? 7.6.5 Lab Homework #7 Use the same data file from this labs tutorial to test whether intellect ratings were different between the gender categories (use alpha = .05). Which gender category had higher intellect ratings? Was this difference significant? What was the effect size? Report your result in a sentence or two, using the example and guidelines above to help with the format and structure. Be sure to submit your writing on Moodle. Graph this result (including 1 SEM error bars) as a bar graph. Submit the .spv file containing your independent t-test and graph on Moodle. Grading: TBD 7.6.6 Example answers to practice problems Intellect ratings for candidates aged 29 or younger (M = 5.33, SD = 1.94) were not significantly different from intellect ratings for candidates over age 29 (M = 5.88, SD = 2.28), as demonstrated by an independent t-test [t(29.70) = -0.74, p &gt; .05]. Note: If you included Cohens d, the value was -0.26, but we often dont report effect size if the effect was not significant. Intellect ratings were not significantly correlated with the age of the candidates, r = .05, p &gt; .05. You should have created four scatterplots. They are included below as well as some notes about each. For the correlation between age and intellect, we found r was very close to 0, at .05. This is reflected in the pattern of dots, which are spread fairly uniformly across the entire plot. There are no concerns with violating the assumption of linearity on this plot. There are also no outliers. For the correlation between time and intellect, we found r was also close to 0 but negative, at -.07. It is harder to link the r with the plot in this case because of the two dots far to the right in the plot. These might be outliers and could be investigated further, but how to do so is not covered in PSYC 292. The correlation between wordcount and intellect was r = -.24. This is a fairly weak correlation but if you focus on the cluster of dots on the left, you can get the impression that there are more dots in the top left and bottom right than the other two quadrants. The dot to the far right might be an outlier and could be investigated further, but how to do so is not covered in PSYC 292. For impression and intellect, a correlation of r = .83 was observed. In the scatterplot, you can see the dots cluster around an imaginary line that goes from the bottom left corner to the top left corner. There are no concerns that the assumption of linearity has been violated. There is also no evidence of outliers. 7.7 JAMOVI This section is copied almost verbatim, with some editorial changes, from Answering questions with data: The lab manual for R, Excel, SPSS and JAMOVI, Lab 7, Section 7.6, SPSS, according to its CC license. Thank you to Crump, Krishnan, Volz, &amp; Chavarga (2018). In this lab, we will use jamovi to: Perform an independent-samples t-test Graph the data 7.7.1 Experiment Background Schroeder and Epley (2015) conducted an experiment to determine whether a persons speech (i.e., vocal tone, cadence, and pitch) communicates information about their intellect better than their written words (even if they are the same words as in the speech). To conduct this study, the authors randomly assigned 39 professional recruiters for Fortune 500 companies to one of two conditions. In the audio condition, participants listened to audio recordings of a job candidates spoken job pitch. In the transcript condition, participants read a transcription of the job candidates pitch. After hearing or reading the pitch, the participants rated the job candidates on three dimensions: intelligence, competence, and thoughtfulness. These ratings were then averaged to create a single measure of the job candidates intellect, with higher scores indicating the recruiters rated the candidates as higher in intellect. The participants also rated their overall impression of the job candidate (a composite of two items measuring positive and negative impressions). Finally, the participants indicated how likely they would be to recommend hiring the job candidate (0 - not at all likely, 10 - extremely likely). So, what happened? Did the recruiters think job applicants were smarter when they read the transcripts, or when the heard the applicants speak? We have the data, and we can find out. 7.7.2 Performing an independent-samples t-test First, lets open the relevant data file in jamovi. The data set is available here. The file we are working with in this lesson is called SchroederEpley2015_Study4_data.sav. Your data should look like this: For our analysis, we will focus on only one of the three measures mentioned above: intellect. We want to know if perceived intellect is different in the audio condition (where recruiters listened to a job pitch) than in the transcript condition (where recruiters read a transcript of a job pitch). Before we run the t-test, lets review the variable attributes by using the Data menu and the Settings button, available at the top of our jamovi spreadsheet window. Check both intellect and CONDITION. When you check CONDITION, notice that this Settings button has revealed the values used to signify the Audio and Transcript groups. Take note that these groups are signified by 0s and 1s. This coding helps the program to run our t-test. Keep in mind that whether we look at the codes or labels does not change anything about the data itself or any subsequent analyses; it is merely a cosmetic change. Remember to check intellect while considering the information about the study (the context). Is intellect a variable measured on a nominal scale? Does it get represented by integer data? Remember to press the Settings button again or to press the upward facing arrows to return to a more full version of your data spreadsheet and Results panel: Now, were ready to run the independent-samples t-test. Go to Analyses, then T-Tests, then Independent Samples T-test. A window will appear asking you to specify which variable to use in this analysis. Remember, we are only using intellect, so find this variable in the left-hand list and move it into the Dependent Variables field on the right using the arrow. For the field labeled Grouping Variable, we will specify which variable is our independent variable. That variable is CONDITION (we have two conditions: audio and transcript). Move CONDITION into the Grouping Variable field. In the Results panel, jamovi will produce an output tables as follows: The t-test output has similarities with the paired t-test output we saw in Chapter 6 of this lab manual. Similarly to what we learned when discussing the paired t-test output, we can click on the Descriptives button to request a second table contains useful descriptive statistics that help us understand the pattern of results and contextualize our inferential statistics. In the case of an independent-samples t-test, there is one special consideration to be made: the equality of variances. One of the assumptions of a t-test is that the groups being compared have roughly equal variances. Conveniently, in jamovi, you can request another test to determine if the variances are equal or not: this test is called the Levenes test. Simply click on Homogeneity test , and the table showing the results will appear between the table depicting the independent-samples t-test and the Descriptives table. When interpreting the second output table, or Levenes test, the rule is as follows: If the p-value in the table is smaller than your alpha level, then your variances are not equal and you should request Welchs t-test. If the p-value for Levenes test is larger than alpha, then you can use the Students t-test that is automatically generated when you request an independent t-test. However, some people may recommend that you always use the Welchs t-test. In this case, the p-value associated with the Levenes test is .35, which is greater than the conventional alpha level of .05, so you could report the results of the Student t-test, but we are still going to use the Welchs t-test. The t-statistic for our independent-samples t-test is -3.48, the degrees of freedom are adjusted to 33.43, and the p-value for the t-test is .001. Note: Be sure to look at the p-value associated with the t-test and not Levenes test when you are interpreting your t-test results. What does the t-test tell us about the data? We can put our finding into words to clarify: Recruiter ratings for audio job pitches (M = 6.63, SD = 1.61) are higher than ratings for transcripts of pitches (M = 4.65, SD = 1.91). This difference is significant, t(33.43) = -3.48, p &lt; .05. You can also include effect sizes in the jamovi output in the first table by clicking on Effect size. You can include Cohens d in your results sentence as well. Find it in the Independent Samples T-Test table in the Effect Size column. For example: Recruiter ratings for audio job pitches (M = 6.63, SD = 1.61) are higher than ratings for transcripts of pitches (M = 4.65, SD = 1.91). This difference is significant according to an independent samples t-test, t(33.4) = -3.48, p &lt; .05, d = 1.13. Some formatting guidelines for writing results sections: All of the numbers are rounded to two decimal places, but if your p-value was .0001, it would be okay to write p &lt; .001. Italicize symbols such as p and t. There are spaces on either side of =, &gt;, or &lt; symbols. 7.7.3 Graphing your data CONDITION in this experiment represents a discrete, categorical variable. Therefore, we will be using a bar chart to visualize this data. To begin, go to Analyses, then Exploration, and then Descriptives. Next, move intellect to the Variables window by highlighting the variable and using the arrow, and move CONDITION to the Split by window. Click on Plots, and then click Bar plot. jamovi will produce a bar graph of your mean ratings for both audio and transcript conditions. Note: Its always a good idea to compare your graph to the descriptive statistics to make sure it looks right. Another Important Note: You cannot simply copy and paste the graph from jamovi into a paper that requires APA-formatting. Be sure to use the other resources provided to you so as to create properly formatted graphs for your course assignments. 7.7.4 Optional exercises (good practice and review for the take-home final exam) At this point, youve covered everything you need to successfully complete the homework assignment below. However, there are a number of different analyses we can practice with this dataset. This section walks you through some optional analyses to consolidate what weve already covered as well as add breadth. If youre running out of time, skip down to the Homework now. You can return to these exercises later (i.e., when studying). 7.7.4.1 Using a cut point to define groups for an independent t-test Sometimes you will see groups defined with a non-nominal independent variable. For example, we might talk about defining countries as overweight or not overweight depending on whether 50% of their population was classified as overweight. The rate of overweight is known for each country, but we can divide the countries into two groups at an arbitrary cut point (in this case, a rate of 50%). Aside: This is a good example of how an ordinal, interval, or ratio variable might be considered to have distinct categories - you have to define the boundaries of the categories yourself first. A commonly used cut point is the median value (this is called a median split). Lets use the example of age in the current dataset. You can find the median value of age in different ways. Lets go with a familiar path: Click Analyses, then Exploration, and then Descriptive Statistics. Move age to the Variables filed. If the median were not showing in the table visible in the Results panel, we could click Statistics and select Median . The first output table contains the median: We can use the median of 29 as the cut point. Well be running an independent t-test to determine whether there is a significant difference in intellect between candidates under 29 years old and over 29 years old. First, we will need to transform the intellect variable. Click Data, then Add, and then either Insert or Append. Notice that when you use Insert, the new, transformed variable is added to the left of whichever variable you have highlighted or were last working in. When you use Append, the new, transformed variable is added to the far right of all the variables. After clicking the commands to get the transformed variable, be sure to name the variable and to write a description. Select the Source variable, by clicking on the drop-down menu and selecting age. Then, create a rule for jamovi to follow to populate the new variable column. To do so, click on using transform and Create New Transform. A new panel will pop up and we will enter our transform rule here. First, we should name the transformation; we might use AgeMedSplit for the transformation name. Next, we must write the recoding rule. Click on Add recode condition. Since our median is 29, we might show that if our source variable has data that is less than 29, it should be recoded as a 1 which we will indicate later to be young. The second part of the recoding rule will indicate what code we want to use if the first part of the rule is not true. Lets use 2 as our other code. We can also indicate that the Measure type is nominal; we have younger and older groups. Click the downward facing arrow to close the transformation window. Click the upward facing arrow to close the transformed variable window. Having split the data by age group, we can now run the t-test on intellect. (Question: When considering the experimental design, would you say these age groups are manipulated or measured?) Click Analyses, T-Tests, and Independent Samples T-Test. Move intellect into the Dependent Variables field by highlighting the variable and using the arrow. Move your newly created, the transformed variable, into the Grouping Variable field in much the same way. In this image, you will see I named the transformed variable Age_MedSplit_YO. Remember to click Descriptives under Additional Statistics to get the Descriptive table and Welchs so that you can report the t-test without worrying whether or not the assumption of homogeneity of variance has been violated: Practice writing a sentence describing the results, and then compare it to #1 in the Example answers to practice problems below. 7.7.4.2 Review: Correlation Lets say you had a different research question: Is the age of the candidate correlated with intellect ratings? You could answer this question with the same variables analyzed in the section above, but using correlation instead of an independent t-test. Click Analyses, Regression, and Correlation Matrix, and then, move age and intellect into the untitled box at the right of the pop-up screeen: In the Results panel, the output table should look as follows: Write a sentence describing the results of this test. Compare your answer to #2 in the Example answers to practice problems below. Now, assume you are in the mood to do some exploratory data analysis. We can run multiple bivariate correlations at the same time in the same dialog. Click Analyses, then Regression, and then Correlation Matrix again. To the untitled variables box at the right, add age, wordcount, time,intellect, andimpression`: In the Results panel, the output table contains the r- and p-values for each possible pair of the five variables: By default, jamovi does not flag significant correlations. Be sure to review the p-values careful and compare them to the alpha level you set. How many significant correlations do you identify in the correlation matrix? If you would like jamovi to flag significant correlations, you can click Flag significant correlations under Additional options. Under the correlation matrix, you will notice a note. If the p-value is under .05, jamovi will flag the correlation coefficient as * (significant at the .05 level); if the p-value is less than .01, SPSS will flag it as ** (significant at the .01 level); and if the p-value is less than .001, SPSS will flag it as *** (significant at the .001 level). Lets pick a few pairs of variables and make scatterplots. We have a good range of different correlations in this table, so we can use these data to practice identifying correlations of different strengths. Click Analyses, Exploration, and then Scatterplot. Move intellect into the Y-Axis and age into the X-Axis. These commands should produce a scatterplot in the Results panel. Repeat for all correlations with intellect, using intellect on the Y axis each time to make it easier to compare to the example answers below (#3). Compare the pattern of dots in each scatterplot to the r-values reported in the tables. Can you see the differences between the plots? Can you tell from the scatterplots whether we have violated any of the assumptions of Pearsons r (i.e., linearity, no outliers)? 7.7.5 Example answers to practice problems Intellect ratings for candidates aged 29 or younger (M = 5.33, SD = 1.94) were not significantly different from intellect ratings for candidates over age 29 (M = 5.88, SD = 2.28), as demonstrated by an independent t-test [t(29.7) = -0.74, p &gt; .05]. Note: If you included Cohens d, the value was -0.26, but we often dont report effect size if the effect was not significant. Intellect ratings were not significantly correlated with the age of the candidates, r = .05, p &gt; .05. You should have created four scatterplots. They are included below as well as some notes about each. For the correlation between age and intellect, we found r was very close to 0, at .05. This is reflected in the pattern of dots, which are spread fairly uniformly across the entire plot. There are no concerns with violating the assumption of linearity on this plot. There are also no outliers. For the correlation between time and intellect, we found r was also close to 0 but negative, at -.07. It is harder to link the r with the plot in this case because of the two dots far to the right in the plot. These might be outliers and could be investigated further, but how to do so is not covered in PSYC 292. The correlation between wordcount and intellect was r = -.24. This is a fairly weak correlation but if you focus on the cluster of dots on the left, you can get the impression that there are more dots in the top left and bottom right than the other two quadrants. The dot to the far right might be an outlier and could be investigated further, but how to do so is not covered in PSYC 292. For impression and intellect, a correlation of r = .83 was observed. In the scatterplot, you can see the dots cluster around an imaginary line that goes from the bottom left corner to the top left corner. There are no concerns that the assumption of linearity has been violated. There is also no evidence of outliers. 7.7.6 Lab Homework #7 Using the data collected in PSYC 291, perform a median split on the Time 2 alcohol consumption variable. Do people who are high consumers of alcohol experience different levels of anxiety at Time 2 (i.e., during midterms) compared to low consumers of alcohol? Conduct the appropriate t-test. What can you conclude? Write your answers in APA format, including the 95% confidence interval and effect size (Cohens d). Using APA format, graph the data. 7.7.7 Practice Problems Use the same data file from this labs tutorial to test whether intellect ratings were different between the gender categories (use alpha = .05). Which gender category had higher intellect ratings? Was this difference significant? What was the effect size? Report your result in a sentence or two, using the example and guidelines above to help with the format and structure. Graph this result (including SEM error bars) as a bar graph. Using the EngageNS data, run an independent samples t-test to examine whether people who volunteer in their community (variable name=VOLUNTEER; 1=yes, 2=no) report feeling higher perceptions of belonging in the community (variable name = BELONGING). Run a second independent-samples t-test to examine whether volunteers report feeling more satisfied with their well-being (CIW_WELLB). What can you conclude from each t-test? Write your answers in APA format, including the 95% confidence intervals and effect sizes (Cohens d). Using APA format, graph the data (Note that you will need to make up separate graphs to report the result of each of the t-tests). Test whether there is a correlation between BELONGING and CIW_WELLB). Using the EngageNS data, run 3 separate independent samples t-tests to examine whether people who were born in Canada (BORN_CAN; 1=yes, 2=no) experience different levels of a) discrimination (DISCRIM1) due to their ethnicity/race/skin colour, b) life satisfaction (LIFESAT), and c) job security (SECURITY) than those not born in Canada. What can you conclude from each t-test? Write your answers in APA format, including the 95% confidence intervals and effect sizes (Cohens d). Using APA format, graph the data (Note that you will need to make up separate graphs to report the result of each of the t-tests). Are there any correlations between DISCRIM1, LIFESAT, and SECURITY? Using the EngageNS data, run 3 separate independent samples t-tests to examine whether people who have internet access at home (INTERNET; 1=yes, 2=no) report different levels of a) work-life balance (WL_BALANCE), b) reading books for pleasure (HM_READ), and c) playing board games/cards with family/friends (HM_CARDS) than those who do not have internet access at home. What can you conclude from each t-test? Write your answers in APA format, including the 95% confidence intervals and effect sizes (Cohens d). Using APA format, graph the data (Note that you will need to make up separate graphs to report the result of each of the t-tests). Are there any correlations between WL_BALANCE, HM_READ, and HM_CARDS? Using the data collected in PSYC 291, test whether there are differences in alcohol consumption at both Time 1 and Time 2 between students who live on campus and those who live off campus. Note that you will have to conduct two independent samples t-tests  one for Time 1 and one for Time 2. What can you conclude from each t-test? Write your answers in APA format, including the 95% confidence intervals and effect sizes (Cohens d). Using APA format, graph the data (Note that you will need to make up separate graphs to report the result of each of the t-tests). Is there a correlation between TIME 1 and TIME 2 alcohol consumption? Using the data collected in PSYC 291, test whether those who have family to visit at least twice a month experience less anxiety than those who do not have family they can visit. What can you conclude from each t-test? Write your answers in APA format, including the 95% confidence intervals and effect sizes (Cohens d). Using APA format, graph the data. Using the data collected in PSYC 291, perform a median split on the Time 1 total self-care variable. Do people who engage in high levels of self-care experience different levels of perceived stress at Time 2 (i.e., during midterms) than those who engage in low levels of self-care? Conduct the appropriate t-test. What can you conclude? Write your answers in APA format, including the 95% confidence interval and effect size (Cohens d). Using APA format, graph the data.
